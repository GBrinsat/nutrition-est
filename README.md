# üçè What is Nutritionest?

Nutritionest is a web application that uses the [Nutritionix API](https://www.nutritionix.com/) to look up the nutritional details of thousands of foods. A user can search for a food and then choose from a list of 20 foods that match that search term. Clicking on one of those food items shows the user the nutritional details (e.g. fat, protein, fiber) for 100g of that food item.

A user can also create a profile and create lists with food items for easy reference.

Nutritionest was created by [Kristof Rombauts](https://github.com/KristofRmbts), [Gerrit Brinsat](https://github.com/GBrinsat), and [Matthew Neckelmann](https://github.com/mneck).
